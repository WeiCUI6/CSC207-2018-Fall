##### What we have done:

##### What decisions we made:
 - We should learn things such as xml files by ourselves, this is very important because we have to use it frequently when writing phase 1.
 - We should have a agreed team opinion about the basic structures of this project phase, best before next CSC207 lab.
 - We need to use next lab time to ask ta if we have some disagreements on major designing pattern about this phase.
##### What each person should do next:
 - Everyone: Think deeper on this project phase by combining own opinion with others' suggestions after exchanging.
 - Everyone: Read the whole code of a2 and distinguish functionalities of each class and relationship between them.
 - Everyone: Learn frontend in android studio.
