### Lab Meeting (29-10-2018)
##### What we have done:
 - Figure out what new classes we should implement, to reach our ideal results in phase 1.
 - Search tutorials on YouTube, learn how to implement xml files and connect them to classes.
##### What decisions we made:
 - We need to implement User and UserManager class, just like the theater example which was given in CSC207 lecture.
 - Serialize will be useful when reading and writing files in process such as log in, saving game and loading game.
 - Different pages can be connected in a most efficient way, we need to prevent redundant pages.
##### What each person should do next:
 - Zhuozi Zou: Implement the User class, determine the structure of it and connection with UserManager.
 - Xinyi Ji: Implement the UserManager class, focus on file saving and loading.
 - Wei Cui: Implement xml files, determine buttons, pages with their functionality and connections.
 - Bohan Jiang: Implement activity files, learn different ways of writing these classes.
 - Kewei Qiu: List the possible connections between xml files and original classes in app, help implementation.
