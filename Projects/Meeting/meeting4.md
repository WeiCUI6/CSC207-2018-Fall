# CSC207 2018Fall Project Phase1
##### Group 0557
---
### Self Meeting (2-11-2018)
##### What we have done:
 - Several xml files and activity classes are created.
 - Structure of the whole phase 1 is fixed.
 - The app can now run, with some missing functions, which is good for testing and debugging.
##### What decisions we made:
 - To prevent file creating issues, we can put userList directly into .ser file and read them if we need.
 - Undo button should be fixed some where on grid board, and it will be better if the button does not cover any tiles.
 - xml and activity files for different size of SlidingTiles game can be merged into one xml and one activity file.
##### What each person should do next:
 - Zhuozi Zou and Xinyi Ji: Find a way to save user information and board information into .ser files.
 - Wei Cui: Try to handle undo button, find a way to put unto button in main xml file by changing the status of grid which already exists.
 - Bohan Jiang: Fix a bug about creating new 4x4 SlidingTiles game.
 - Kewei Qiu: Help Bohan to fix the bug. Learn things about uploading image and cropping image.
